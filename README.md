## Reflection 
In this project, I made a small Micro CRM Leads Tracker app. 
I used Node.js and Express for the back end and vanilla JavaScript for the front end. 
The app lets the user add new leads, view all leads, and update the status of each lead. 
All the data is stored in a JSON file, and Express handles the routes for these actions. 
The front end connects to the back end with fetch requests, and the results are displayed in the browser.

By building this project, I learned how a full-stack app works and how the front 
end and back end communicate with each other. I also learned how to create routes with Express, how to send and receive JSON data, 
and how to serve static files from a “public” folder.

If I continue with this project, I would like to improve the design of the app and add some additional features, such as color-coding the lead statuses. 
I would also add a delete button, because right now the user is not able to delete any leads from the table.
